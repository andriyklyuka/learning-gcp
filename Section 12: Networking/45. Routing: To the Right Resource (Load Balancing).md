# routing - to right resource

- latency reduction
    - use closer servers

- load balancing 
    - separate not auto-scaling

- system desing
    - different systems for different functions
    - micro services

- cross-region load balancing 

- cloud load balancer

- http(s) load balancer 

## unicast vs anycast

unicast - unique device (only one device can handle request)

anycast - multiple devices (send to any device, but idealy the closest)

## Layer 4 vs7 

- tcp (layer 4)

- http (later 7)

- layers build on the one below

- cant route on path in layer 4

## what about dns?

- dns can be first in routing

- layer 4 cannot route based on url path

- chunky - often cached and reused for hube clients sets

- sticky - timed before the cache is cleared
    - extra cost to clear cahse 
    - more money for dns requests

- not robust - relies on client (boo)

- premium tier "cold potato" routing with anycast IPs avoids these problems
