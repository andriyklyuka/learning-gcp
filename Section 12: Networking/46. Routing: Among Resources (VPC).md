# resource to resource data

- VPS(global) - virtual private cloud - you private sdn in gcp
    - not just resource-to-resource - also manages doors to outside

- subets (regional) create logical spaces to cointain resources
    - all subnets reach all others - globally, without any need for VPNs

- routes (global) denie (next hop) for traffic based on destination IPO
    - routes are global and apply by instance-lvl tags

- firewall rules (global) - further data restriction

## ip and cidrs

- ip address is abc.def.ghi.jkl (dotted quad) where each piece is 0-255

- cidr block is a group of ip addresses specified in <IP>/xy notations
    - turn ip address into 32-bit binary number
        - ie 10.10.0.254 -> 00001010 00001010 00000000 11111110
    - /xy in CIDR notation locks highest(leftmost) bits in IP address (0-32)
    - abc.def.ghi.jkl/32 is a single IP address because all 32 bits are locked
    - abc.def.ghi.jkl/24 is 256 IP addresses becase last 8 bits (jkl) can vary
    - 0.0.0.0/0 means any IP address (no bits are locked)
- RFC1918 defines private (i.e. non-internet) addresses ranges you can use:
    - 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, and 192.168.0.0/16
